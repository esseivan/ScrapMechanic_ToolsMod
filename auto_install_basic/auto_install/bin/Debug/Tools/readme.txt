Reason of why you have to edit files in game data folder :
This mod is using tools (like the spudgun), not blocks. Scrap Mechanic doesn't allow (for now) mods with custom tools, so you have to edit game files to implement them.

Open the mod folder ( ...\steamapps\workshop\content\387990\1505812019\ )
Open the howToUse.txt file
